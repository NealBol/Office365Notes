# Office 365 Groups

### What Are Office 365 Groups?

Office 365 Groups are created by end users from within Outlook Online and allow file sharing, conversations, group calendars and appointments, a shared OneNote Notebook and can even allow connections to external services which will push notifcations to the group.

They are a unifying collaboration tool that brings together aspects of SharePoint and Exchange Online into a quickly available shared environment that allows a group to connect with each other in a somewhat informal way.

### Office 365 Group Governance

#### Things to Consider

By default, any user can create these groups
A SharePoint site collection that is not visible anywhere within the SharePoint interface is created
Storage is of course consumed by these groups
You cannot set a retention policy on the groups
